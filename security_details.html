<h1 id="security">Security</h1>
<p>Here at [COMPANY NAME HERE] we take security very seriously. One such
aspect is how we save user data.</p>
<h2 id="users">Users</h2>
<p>Users are the backbone of our platform, and as such we need to keep
their passwords safe. To do so we have implemented a system of hashing
and salting passwords.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>To achieve this level of security we have 4 main frameworks that do
the job.</p>

<h3 id="express">Express</h3>
<p>Express is an HTTP wrapper around node’s built in http library. It
will help us send data and websites to and from the browser. It also
supports something called “middlewares”, which will help us authenticate
a user before they are allowed on a website.</p>
<h3 id="passport.js">Passport.js</h3>
<p>Passport.js is a middleware library for express. It will save a
cookie in the user’s browser, then whenever the user wants to check out
a restricted route passport.js will check the cookie for the correct
user and if they have permission.</p>
<h3 id="bcrypt">bcrypt</h3>
<p>Bcrypt is a library for hasing passwords. It is used to safely save
passwords. To find out if a user wrote the same password we take their
input, mush it in the same way that we mushed the previous password, and
see if the result is the same. If something happens where an attacker
finds the hashed password it will be very difficult for them to find out
the original password. All they can do is try and try again with many
passwords until they stumble upon the right one. Which is why you still
need a strong password.</p>
<h3 id="sqlite">SQLite</h3>
<p>We use SQLite to store our data. SQLite is a database solution that
saves the data to a single file. Unlike PostgreSQL or MySQL/MariaDB or
MongoDB there is no setup involved. Just one file. As such it makes the
database really portable, while remaining a strong choice for saving
data. SQLite uses the SQL syntax, so it will be easy in the future to
switch to a more advanced database.</p>
<h2 id="threat">Threat</h2>
<p>To mitigate against brute forcing attacks we have limited every IP to
only 10 logins every 15 min. This should protect us against DDoSing, And
only 100 requests for every 15 min on the whole site.</p>
<h1 id="development">Development</h1>
<p>The development started on GitHub. We made a couple of issues and
then set them up in a GitHub project.</p>

<p>Then just work on one issue at a time and fix others along the
way.</p>
