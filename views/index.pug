	h1#security Security
	p
		| Here at [COMPANY NAME HERE] we take security very seriously. One such
		| aspect is how we save user data.
	h2#users Users
	p
		| Users are the backbone of our platform, and as such we need to keep
		| their passwords safe. To do so we have implemented a system of hashing
		| and salting passwords.
	h2#setup Setup
	p
		| To achieve this level of security we have 4 main frameworks that do
		| the job.

	h3#express Express
	p
		| Express is an HTTP wrapper around node&rsquo;s built in http library. It
		| will help us send data and websites to and from the browser. It also
		| supports something called &ldquo;middlewares&rdquo;, which will help us authenticate
		| a user before they are allowed on a website.
	h3(id='passport.js') Passport.js
	p
		| Passport.js is a middleware library for express. It will save a
		| cookie in the user&rsquo;s browser, then whenever the user wants to check out
		| a restricted route passport.js will check the cookie for the correct
		| user and if they have permission.
	h3#bcrypt bcrypt
	p
		| Bcrypt is a library for hasing passwords. It is used to safely save
		| passwords. To find out if a user wrote the same password we take their
		| input, mush it in the same way that we mushed the previous password, and
		| see if the result is the same. If something happens where an attacker
		| finds the hashed password it will be very difficult for them to find out
		| the original password. All they can do is try and try again with many
		| passwords until they stumble upon the right one. Which is why you still
		| need a strong password.
	h3#sqlite SQLite
	p
		| We use SQLite to store our data. SQLite is a database solution that
		| saves the data to a single file. Unlike PostgreSQL or MySQL/MariaDB or
		| MongoDB there is no setup involved. Just one file. As such it makes the
		| database really portable, while remaining a strong choice for saving
		| data. SQLite uses the SQL syntax, so it will be easy in the future to
		| switch to a more advanced database.
	h2#threat Threat
	p
		| To mitigate against brute forcing attacks we have limited every IP to
		| only 10 logins every 15 min. This should protect us against DDoSing, And
		| only 100 requests for every 15 min on the whole site.
	h1#development Development
	p
		| The development started on GitHub. We made a couple of issues and
		| then set them up in a GitHub project.

		| Then just work on one issue at a time and fix others along the
		| way.
